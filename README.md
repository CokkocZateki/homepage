## How to edit

If you only need to edit a service or a leadership personnel, you can directly edit the file `data.json` in Github, the website will be updated automatically.

If you want to touch up the CSS or add new elements, you will need a running NodeJS environment and bower.

    git clone https://github.com/J4LP/homepage.git
    npm install
    bower install
    # make your edits
    gulp watch # reloads automatically
    # commit and push or look into making a pull request
